This project set the task of creating a bot to compete in a first-price sealed bid auction for paintings, 
whereby an obtained collection meeting the winning condition would result in a winning of the whole auction. 
The goal of this report is to highlight and explain the strategic design behind the implementation of the created auction bot, 
giving insight into the theory and system process used to create the final bot.
